## About

vim-symbols-strings is a plugin that converts Ruby symbols to strings and vice versa. It can be used in conjunction with vim operator commands.

## Usage

For now, the commands are frozen as follows:

* `<Leader>g<movement modifiers>` to convert symbols to strings - e.g. `<Leader>gi(` will convert all symbols inside parenthesis to strings
* `<Leader>l<movement modifiers>` to convert strings to symbols - e.g. `<Leader>li(` will convert all strings inside parenthesis to symbols

## Caveat Emptor

The definition of what constitutes a string or a symbol is fairly naive - I tend to use largely letters and underscores in symbols and so the regexps will only recognise those for conversion - am hoping that this covers most fo the use cases

## Installation

The easiest way to install this would be to use Pathogen and include the git repo as a git submodule in your bundle.
